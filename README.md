# NBA Statistics
Calculates field goal percentage, free throw percentage, true shooting percentage and turnover percentage.

# Purpose
I always enjoyed watching the NBA growing up. I didn't want to do the calculations for a player's stat. So, I decided to make a dedicated program for solving these calculations.

# How it works
While running the program, a display menu asks the user to enter one of the four choices listed. When the user chooses one of the four choices, they enter information and receive a result. The program will ask if the user wants to quit the program or continue calculating player stat.
